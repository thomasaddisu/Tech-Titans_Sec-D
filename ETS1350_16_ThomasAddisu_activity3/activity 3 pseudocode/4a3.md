# Pseudocode: 

1. Start the program
2. Declare integer variables `row`, `column`
3. Read `row`
4. For `i = 0` to `i < row`:\
    a. For `z = 0` to `z <= i`:
        - Print `z + 1` followed by a space\
    b. For `j = row - 1` to `j > i`:
        - Print two spaces\
    c. Print a new line after each iteration of the outer loop
5. End the program
