equals the number




# Pseudocode

1. Start the program
2. Read integer number 
3. Initialize the sum of divisor of a number to  (divisor_sum = 0)
4. Find the proper divisor of a number
5. Calculate the sum of proper divisor of a number
6. Check the sum is equal to the number it self \
   6.1 If it is equal: \
       - Print number and "it is perfect number"\
       - Go to step 7 \
   6.2 If it is not: \
       - Print  number and "it is not perfect number" \
       - Go to step 7 \
   
7. close the program
