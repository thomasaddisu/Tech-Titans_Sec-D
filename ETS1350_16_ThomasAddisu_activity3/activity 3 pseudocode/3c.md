# Question:
c) Find the product of even digits of the a given number (e.g. input=4,923 prod=8)



# Pseudocod

1. Start the program
2. Read integer number 
3. Initialize the product to 1(to store the product of even digits)
4. Calculate  digit as
 if (num!=0),
  digit=num%10\
   and num/=10\
  else \
  goto step 6

5. Calculate the product\
   if(digit%2==0),
      product*=digit\
      go to step 4\
    else,\
    goto step 4
6.If product == 1 (this means no even digits were found):
    - Set `product = 0`
7. Print the product
8. End the program
