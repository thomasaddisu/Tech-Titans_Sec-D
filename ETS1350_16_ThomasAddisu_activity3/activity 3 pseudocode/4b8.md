1. Start the program
2. Declare integer variable `row`
3. Read `row`
4. For `t = 1` to `t <= row`:\
    a. For `i = 0` to `i < t`:
        - Print a space\
    b. For `j = row + 1` to `j > t`:
        - Print "* " (star followed by a space)\
    c. Print a new line after each iteration of the outer loop
