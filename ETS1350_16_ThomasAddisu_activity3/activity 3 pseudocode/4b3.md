# Pseudocode:

1. Start the program
2. Declare character variable `letter = 'a'`
3. Declare integer variable `row`
4. Read `row`
5. If `row > 26`:\
    a. Print "Row number can't be greater than the number of uppercase letters"\
    b. End the program
6. For `i = 0` to `i < row`:\
    a. For `j = 0` to `j <= i`:
        - Print `letter` followed by a space
        - Increment `letter` by 1\
    b. Set `letter = 'a'`\
    c. Print a new line after each iteration of the outer loop
7. End the program
